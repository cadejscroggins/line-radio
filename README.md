# Lineradio

I'm a fan of the music streaming service [8tracks](https://8tracks.com/), but I generally feel like I'm taking shots in the dark when choosing a playlist. [Lineradio](https://linerad.io/) streamlines this experience by automatically playing playlists related to what you search for. You don't have to randomly select anythingâ€”just listen. If you don't like what you hear, hit refresh and a new playlist automatically starts playing. Nice!

## Developer Setup

You're gonna need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then:

```bash
# download the source
git clone https://github.com/cadejscroggins/lineradio
cd lineradio

# install the things
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
npm install
bower install

# start the dev server
grunt serve
```

## Contributing

Don't do it. I plan on completely rewriting this site with Angular 2 in the future. (:
