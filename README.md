Line Radio
==========

A minimal website for finding new music.

Setup
-----

* Install the global stuff (root, NPM & RubyGems are required, don't be silly).
```bash
gem install sass
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

* Install the package specific stuff.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cadejscroggins/line-radio
cd line-radio
npm install
bower install
```

* Watch for changes.
```bash
grunt watch
```

* Fix everything that doesn't work.

* Dance.
