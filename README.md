Line Radio
==========

A minimal website for finding new music.

Setup
-----

Install the global stuff (NPM & RubyGems are required, don't be silly).
```bash
gem install sass
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Install the package specific stuff.
```bash
npm install
bower install
```

Watch for changes.
```bash
grunt watch
```

Things will be spit out in the `_site/` directory. Enjoy!
